# flasky-doo
A collection of all the flask(python) related stuffs that I will be learning from scratch to possibly some cool small & big open sourced projects.Learning is through a online sources, all the learnings or the concepts are named in the format flasky-doo(1,2,3...) initially while executing all were named as "app.py", learning modules can be ran like any other python file via terminal, to access outputs copy and paste the url that appears on cmd/(route if nay specified eg.home,json). As I go ahead step by step projects will be named properly as per their functioning.
